=== What is this?

As you've probably guessed already, this is a replacement for the ``cat`` command-line tool, but all of the file output is meowified, just like in ``cowsay``, but with cats, not cows.

=== Why did I even make this?

Because cats are cute...

=== Installation (Linux and macOS)

Needs Tcl 8.4 or newer to operate and nothing else. On Ubuntu, install Tcl with ``sudo apt-get install tclsh -y``.

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/meowcat http://meow.roveramd.com/meowcat.tcl
$ sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/meowcat
----

If you prefer ``meowcat`` over regular ``cat``, create an alias to ``meowcat`` from ``cat``:

[source,bash]
----
$ alias cat=meowcat
----

=== Usage

[source,bash]
----
meowcat <additional flags> <files>
----

Available flags:

[squares]
- **-u** - draws a happy cat with an UwU face.
- **-h<rows>** - height of the cat's body in stdout rows. Default value is **6**.
- **-f<offset>** - offset from the left. Default value is **5**.

You can specify **-** as the input filename to read from stdin.

Examples:

[source,bash]
----
$ meowcat -h4 -f2 /etc/mandriva-release
